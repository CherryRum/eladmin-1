## Things that are much interesting

- [JEP 457: Class-File API (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/457)
  Goals
    - Provide an accurate, complete, performant, and standard API for reading, writing, and transforming Java class
      files, which tracks the class-file specification.
    - Enable the replacement of existing uses of ASM within the JDK, eventually enabling the removal of the JDK's
      internal copy of the ASM library. We may similarly be able to remove the JDK's two custom internal class-file
      libraries.
